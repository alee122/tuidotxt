# tuidotxt

Tui app that conforms to todo.txt files.

I have found it useful to have a running todo list, and then pull from it for things I want to accompish today.
Things that I accomplish today can either be done (and so removed from the view) or stuck for some outside reason, and then moved over to stuck.

It started as GTD but I find that being more specific than "don't forget this, but you don't have to do it today" isn't particularly helpful for me; it's a combination of everything but the "waiting for" list.
The "stuck" list is the "waiting for" list.
The "today" list pulls from the "to do" list and should be a reasonable number of things to get done given my schedule.

So far I've been doing all this in Trello, but I want an easier to use snooze function and I want vim bindings.
